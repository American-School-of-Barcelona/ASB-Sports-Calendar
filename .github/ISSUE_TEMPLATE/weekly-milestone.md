## This Week's Goal

<!-- "I will focus on collecting my data through jeeb.cat and FCF as well as building/defining my database schema" -->



## Connection to Success Criteria
<!-- Which Success Criteria does this milestone support? -->
<!-- "Finding specific addresses and dates of matches for each individual team" -->


## Definition of Done
<!-- How will you know you've completed this milestone? Be specific. -->
<!-- Example: "A specific address is given for a specific game in the form needed" -->


## Plan / Approach
<!-- What steps will you take? What resources are you using? -->
<!-- "Finding and collecting all dates and addresses of matches using jeeb.cat and FCF, then determining how it will be displayed within the web." -->

-->


## Blockers / Questions
<!-- What's blocking you? What do you need help with? -->
<!-- Mon: "Could not find all addresses and locations of Basketball games until I found jeeb.cat" -->
<!-- Wed: "Must find a way to store my data and then define the schema for it."-->


## End of Week Reflection
<!-- At the end of the week, before closing this issue: -->
<!-- - Did you meet your Definition of Done? -->

<!-- "Not entirely, I found the data I need in order to construct my database but now I need to define how I will do that." -->

<!-- - What worked well? -->
<!-- - What would you do differently next time? -->
<!-- - What's the logical next milestone? -->

<!-- - "I succeded in finding my data, and that went well." --> 
<!-- - "Next time I would define my schema before in order to make the process easier and help me transition more smoothly." -->
<!-- - "The logical next milestone is like I mentioned creating my database schema and structuring my data in order to move forward" -->
